Nestle Polo Mints were originally introduced by Rowntrees in 1948 and during those early dark years of production they didn’t actually have a hole in them.
<br>
By 1955 Rowntrees had got their act together and introduced the all-important hole – and the rest is history. Polos are as popular today as ever; a staggering 20 million Polos are produced every day!

Many people hold a special place in their heart for Polos – they really are a classic British mint.
