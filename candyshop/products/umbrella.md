The Regina Chocolate Umbrella brings back many childhood memories to many Portuguese. In the original format of an umbrella, around a colourful plastic stick, this milk chocolate treat continues to put smiles on many faces.

The sweet smell of chocolate started spreading in the Alcântara neighbourhood of Lisbon with the arrival of the first Regina factory in 1928. We can confirm the chocolate umbrellas remain irresistible: they are one of our bestsellers at A Vida Portuguesa shops, bringing joy to young and old with a sweet tooth.
